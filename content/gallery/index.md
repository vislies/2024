# VisLies 2024 Gallery

This year, hurricanes Helene and Milton wreaked havoc on Florida where the [IEEE
Vis conference] and hence [VisLies] was supposed to be. So, this year back to
meeting online.

## Inflated Bars

[Ken Moreland] started us off with this quick example. Here we see what appears
to be a bar chart, but it makes not sense. First of all, the bars do not
adequately reflect the values of the poll. Perhaps this was never intended to be
a bar chart, but it's layout is confusing.

But even worse, inflation seems to be affecting these numbers. More than 100% of
people said no, and even more said yes. We suspect someone made a math error.
